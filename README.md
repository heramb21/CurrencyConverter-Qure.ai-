### Currency Converter:

### Problem Statement:

Create a Currency Converter app that allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another. The app should fetch real-time exchange rates from a public API (you can choose a reliable currency exchange API) and support a variety of currencies.

### Features:

1. **Currency Selection:** Users can choose a base and target currency from dropdown menus.
2. **Amount Input:** Allow users to input the amount they want to convert.
3. **Real-time Display:** Display the converted amount in real-time as users enter or change the input.
4. **Swap Currencies:** Include a button to switch the base and target currencies.
5. **History & Preferences:** Provide a history feature for recent conversions

The app uses [Rate Exchange API](https://ratesexchange.eu/)
